## About The Project
//Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, impacting their self-esteem, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. While there are various skincare products and treatments available, the effectiveness of these solutions often depends on accurately assessing the severity of acne and tailoring the approach to individual needs//silakan diganti dengan yang sesuai

## The Project Scope
Part of each learning path: 
- Machine Learning
//Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, impacting their self-esteem, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. While there are various skincare products and treatments available, the effectiveness of these solutions often depends on accurately assessing the severity of acne and tailoring the approach to individual needs//silakan diganti dengan yang sesuai 

- Cloud Computing 
The Cloud Computing team will set up a cloud service to deploy a machine learning model on a cloud run and App Engine. We will use cloud SQL to store database for users. Additionally, we have created a REST API application for Login system and machine learning model for predict Acne Level.
