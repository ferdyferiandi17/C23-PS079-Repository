## About The Project
Acne is a common skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, impacting their self-esteem, mental well-being, and overall quality of life. With the Machine Learning on AnceFy, we can identify acne level severity just using the image capture on our face skin. The results is classifying our acne severity level then gives us various local skincare products and treatments available.

## The Project Scope
Part of each learning path: 
- Machine Learning
The Machine Learning team will collect the dataset picture from Kaggle for making the model of Machine Learning and collect data for making daily skincare recommedation. Then making a model Mobilenet for the Machine Learning by using Tensorflow. The last, do the training until reach the greatest accuracy. 

- Cloud Computing 
The Cloud Computing team will set up a cloud service to deploy a machine learning model on a cloud run and App Engine. We will use cloud SQL to store database for users. Additionally, we have created a REST API application for Login system and machine learning model for predict Acne Level.

- Mobile Development
The skin care recommendation app is a mobile application designed to provide personalized skin care recommendations to users based on their specific skin type, concerns, and preferences. The scope of this project involves the development of the mobile app, including its features, functionality, and user interface.
